# Prediction-using-Supervised-ML-
## This Supervised ML project predicts the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.

It is a simple linear linear regression task which involves just 2 variables.

I have used **python language** for this project.

The libraries used are :
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-Learn

Dataset available here :[Dataset](http://bit.ly/w-data)

The Linear Regression model predicts the precentage of a student if he/she studies for specified hours.
